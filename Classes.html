                    <h2> Boxing</h2>
                    <p>Our basic boxing class is tailored to work the fundamental skills required not only in boxing, but martial arts striking as a whole. The curriculum focuses on stance, footwork, guard, and more. The class serves as a fantastic introduction into martial arts or a great way to refine your boxing technique in a safe, low stakes environment. Basic boxing features a lot of live, partner drills that will build up the skills and confidence needed to safely spar, but there is no sparring in our basic boxing class. We meet once a week every Monday at 3:00 p.m to 3:45 p.m. No gear is required, but boxing gloves are recommended</p>

                    <h2> Submission Grappling</h2>
                    <p>Our submission grappling class teaches grappling completely on its own. We will cover everything from takedowns to groundwork to submissions and how to defend it all. The submission grappling curriculum is built almost entirely from live partner work so expect a lot of, albeit structured, wrestling and sparring. Submission grappling’s a perfect class for students with little to no experience in addition to experienced grapplers. Submission grappling is done entirely “no-gi” and requires no uniform or equipment. Submission grappling meets twice a week Monday & Wednesday from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.</p>

                    <h2> Muay Thai</h2>
                    <p>Come learn the “art of eight limbs” in our Muay Thai classes. Our curriculum covers punching, kicking, elbows, and knees as well as work from clinch such as sweeps. We will cover all the technical aspects of Muay Thai. A large majority of this class's work will be done through padwork. Padwork will also be intense physically and build up student’s fitness levels in addition to their striking ability. For Muay Thai we require 16 oz heavy gloves as a minimum and shin guards are recommended. If you’re coming to Muay Thai with a friend it is in your best interest to make sure one of you has Thai pads. Muay Thai meets twice a week Monday 3:50 p.m to 4:55 p.m & Thursday from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.</p>

                    <h2 > MMA</h2>
                    <p>MMA stands for mixed martial arts and our MMA class is exactly that. In MMA, we focus on working both striking and grappling together. We will cover a wide range of positions, entries, and exits. We will also train a lot of live drills in this class; be prepared to spar. We meet once a week on Wednesday at 3:50 p.m to 4:55. For MMA, gloves and shin guards are required.</p>

                    <h2> Kickboxing</h2>
                    <p>Kickboxing has its roots spread between karate, boxing, and Muay Thai. While kickboxing shares similarities with these martial arts, it has unique characteristics that make it a challenging and deadly martial art. Our kickboxing class will cover punching, kicking and knee strikes. Much of kickboxing will be done with a partner and/or on Thai pads so come prepared. Please bring boxing gloves, shin guards, and Thai pads if you have them. We meet once a week on Tuesday from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. in mat room B.</p>
